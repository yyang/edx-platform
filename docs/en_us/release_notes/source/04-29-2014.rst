edX Learning Management System
***************************************

* Lines in bulk email messages were not wrapped at 998 characters, which caused
  error messages and erroneous characters in some email programs. All lines are
  now wrapped at 998 characters automatically. (LMS-1466)

* Occasionally student submissions for MatLab problems are not graded
  successfully and the MatLab grader times out. There is now a **Reset** button
  that allows students to resubmit their answer without counting the
  resubmission and another attempt of the problem.
